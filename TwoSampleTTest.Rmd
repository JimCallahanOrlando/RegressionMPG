This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Make mockup of MPG data
data(sleep)
str(sleep)
mpg <- sleep$extra
am  <- as.integer(sleep$group)
car <- as.integer(sleep$ID)
mock <- as.data.frame(cbind(mpg, am, car))
str(mock)
mock$mpg <- 15 + (mock$mpg * 4)
mock$am  <- factor(mock$am, labels = c("automatic", "manual") )
mock$car <- factor(mock$car)

```



## Paired versus independent
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(mock, aes(x = am, y = mpg, group = factor(car)))
g <- g + geom_line(size = 1, aes(colour = car)) + 
     geom_point(size =10, pch = 21, 
               fill = "salmon", alpha = .5)
g + labs(x = "transmission", title = "Mockup of MPG Difference \nUsing Paired Car Models")
```
